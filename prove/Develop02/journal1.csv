10/9/2025 | What happened today that you're most excited about? | I was able to write this journal program with help from questions I searched on stackoverflow. Some of the things I had to do, hadn't been taught yet in the previous lessons; so I got the feel of what people say that programming is like solving a puzzle. I feel I successfully solved this puzzle.
10/9/2025 | Did anything happen today that made you anxious? | Working on this program made me a little anxious, because I wasn't sure how to do certain things; and I'm bad at asking people for help. I then remembered the stackoverflow website the instructor recommended us use and typed questions until I found something that helped me.
